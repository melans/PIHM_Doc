# Landsurface {#surf}
Water balance on landsurface of each element.

$$ \frac {dS_{sf}}{dt} = P_{net} - E_{ic} -  q_{inf} - q_{sf} $$


where 

- $S$ Ground water storage  [ $m$ ]
- $q_r$ Recharge to ground water [ $m/T$ ]
- $q_{sf}$ Horizontal ground water flow at three directions [ $m^3/T$ ]
  $$q_{sf} = \sum_{j=1}^3 {Q_{j} } / {A}$$
- $Q_{j}$ Horizontal ground water flow at three directions [ $m^3/T$ ]
- $A$ Area of the element, [ $m^2$ ].

## Infiltration
Green-Ampt equations.
$$q_{inf} = K_{eff} * \Delta \theta \frac{y0 + h_{f}}{h_f}$$
```{r}
library(PIHMgisR)
y0=0:100/100
theta=0.5 * (0:10)/10
Ksat = 0.1 #m/day
qi=theta * 0
for(i in 1:length(theta)){
  for(j in 1:length(y0)){
    qi[i]=GreenAmpt(theta[i], thetas = 0.5, ksat = Ksat, Hfront = 0)

## Overland flow
St. Venant equations
Continuity equation

$$ \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial A}{\partial t}=0 $$

Momentum Equation
$$ \frac{1}{A} \frac{\partial Q}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{A} \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{Q^{2}}{A}\right)+g \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}-g\left(S_{o}-S_{f}\right)=0 $$
Assumptions for St. Venant Equations

- Flow is one-dimensional
- Hydrostatic pressure prevails and vertical accelerations are negligible
- Streamline curvature is small. 
- Bottom slope of the channel is small.
- Manningâ€™s equation is used to describe resistance effects
- The fluid is incompressible
