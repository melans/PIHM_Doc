# Lake

Water balance of lake:
$$
  \frac{d S_{lake}}{d t} = P - E + ( q_{sf} +  q_{gw} + q_{riv})
$$
where 

- $S_{lake}$ Lake water storage  [$m$]
- $P$ Precipitation [$m/T$]
- $E$ Evaporation from lake [$m/T$]
- $q_{sf}$ Water flow from landsurface to lake, [$m/T$] $$q_{sf} = \sum_{j=1}^{Nele} Q_{j}^{sf} / A_{lake}$$
- $q_{gw}$ Water flow from ground water to lake, [$m/T$] $$q_{gw} = \sum_{j=1}^{Nele} Q_{j}^{gw} / A_{lake}$$
- $q_{riv}$  Water PIHM++.pngflow from rivers to lake, [$m/T$] $$q_{riv} = \sum_{j=1}^{Nriv} Q_{j}^{riv} / A_{lake}$$
- $Nele$ and $Nriv$ are number of elements and river adjecent to the lake respectively. [$-$]
- $A_i$ Area of the elements $i$, [$m^2$].
