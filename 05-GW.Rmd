# Saturated Zone {#gw}

## Impervious boundary
## Horizontal flow
$$ \frac {dS_{gw}}{dt} = q_r + q_{gw}$$

where 

- $S$ Ground water storage  [$m$]
- $q_r$ Recharge to ground water [$m/T$]
- $q_{gw}$ Horizontal ground water flow at three directions [$m^3/T$]
  $$q_{gw} = \sum_{j=1}^3 Q_{j} / A$$
- $A$ Area of the elements $i$, [$m^2$].
